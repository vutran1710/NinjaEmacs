* Introduction
Here is my setup guide & tutorial on how-to-use from basic to advance features of my Emacs.

* Setup
- Download Emacs from https://emacsformacosx.com/
- Clone the repo
#+begin_src shell
$ mkdir ~/.emacs.d
$ git clone https://github.com/vutran1710/NinjaEmacs.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src
- Go to Launchpad and hit Emacs
- Wait for it to finish installing

* How to use
** Keybindings
It is advised to re-map *Modifier Keys*.

The general keybindings for navigation are similar to default Emacs' keybindings,
with some extras.

This emacs setup comes with Ivy/Counsel, Dashboard, some IDE-setup scripts based on languages. There are some
custom keybindings too. The most important are

*** Navigation
- ~C-f~ for cursor forward, ~C-b~ backward, ~C-n~ & ~C-p~ for cursor moving up & down by single line
- ~M-f~ & ~M-b~ for cursor forward/backward by word, ~M-n~ & ~M-p~ for cursor moving up/down by Paragraph
- ~M-d~ & ~M-v~ for delete forward/backward by word
- ~C-d~ & ~C-v~ for delete forward/backward by char

*** Working in Project(s)
Using ~Projectile~ we have some general keybindings as following:
- ~C-;~ find file in project
- ~C-c p p~ switch to project
- ~C-t~ fast-jump to any buffer (like opened-tabs in other editor)
- ~C-c p s~ search any text within project (can use regex)

*** Install/Disable IDE setup
Go to `custom.el`, find /Language IDE/ section and comment/uncomment ides for language to your needs

** Refactoring: search & replace text accross the project
- Use *iedit, counsel-ag, ivy-ocur*
- Keybinding consequence:
  1. *counsel-ag*: /C-c p s/
  2. Type in the text to be replace
  3. *ivy-ocur*: /C-c C-o/
  4. *ivy-wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode*: /C-x C-q/
  5. pick text, then *iedit-mode*: /M-r/
  6. when done, save with the usual /C-x C-s/ then *wgrep-finish-edit*: /C-c C-c/
